# Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy
This project builds an end-to-end Customer Churn Prediction System using Machine Learning (LightGBM) combined with a Business Decision Layer to help companies not only identify which customers are at risk, but also determine:
- Who should be prioritized for retention
- How much maximum incentive should be offered
- Expected financial loss if the customer churns
- Personalized retention strategies based on customer behavior

The final system is deployed as an interactive Streamlit application where users can input customer attributes and receive both the churn prediction and the recommended business action.
